
based on bullet 2.81


to port the test classes then the first demo with broadphase to establish port policy.
then try to find people to help me complete the port :)

policy:

suppress the btPrefix since we have namespacing
btMatrix3x3 -> Matrix33

shorten type literals to compact form
Matrix3x3 -> Mtx33

port function name as provided
port constructor under a from*Type* form

keep data structure roughly the same ( array stay as arrays )
try to abstract from java port to start.
